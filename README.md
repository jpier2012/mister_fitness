# MisterFitness

With MisterFitness you can log your workouts online to keep track of your athletic progress over time. You can also share your workouts with your friends to add some friendly competition! MisterFitness even makes it easy to duplicate a friend's workout for an added convenience. Each workout is composed of exercises that are created from scratch or cloned from existing exercises.

This is my second project as a Flatiron school student.

# Instructions

After ceating a login, create your first workout or check out the Community Workouts page to see workouts other users have created. From there you can clone another user's workout to create a duplicate in your name, which creates a new record with the same information but with its own completed date.

Exercises work similarly - when editing a workout you can add exercises that have been created by other people via an exercise dropdown list on the workout edit page.

Once you've gotten your workouts created, every time you exercise, just clone a previous workout and edit it if the information changes. This way, tracking your activity is as easy as ever!
